# CUSTOMER-SEGMENTATION-ANALYSIS

 This project explores customer segmentation analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and K-Means clustering. The objective is to group customers into distinct segments based on their characteristics, allowing businesses to tailor marketing strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.

 Libraries Used
Pandas: Essential for data manipulation and analysis, enabling efficient data preprocessing and feature engineering.
NumPy: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and is used for numerical operations.
Scikit-learn: A comprehensive machine learning library that includes the K-Means clustering algorithm for segmenting customers.

Project Overview
The project follows these key steps:
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Customer data is imported into a Pandas DataFrame, with necessary preprocessing such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into customer characteristics are gained through EDA, identifying patterns and relationships within the data.
Feature Selection: Relevant features are chosen based on business context and EDA findings.
Normalization: Selected features are normalized to ensure consistency in scale, as K-Means is sensitive to feature scaling.
K-Means Clustering: The K-Means algorithm is applied to the normalized data, grouping customers based on similarities.
Cluster Evaluation: The quality of clustering is assessed using metrics like the silhouette score and elbow method.
Cluster Profiling: Each segment's characteristics are analyzed to understand unique traits and preferences.
Usage
To run the project, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. The project includes Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts for executing the customer segmentation analysis.
